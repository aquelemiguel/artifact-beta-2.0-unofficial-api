# ðŸŽ´ Artifact Beta 2.0 Unofficial API
An unofficial (and WIP) open-source API for [**@ValveSoftware**](https://github.com/ValveSoftware)'s Artifact Beta 2.0 to allow eager long hauler developers to create Artifact projects while they wait for the official release.

## Getting started
Visit the API link on [**this repository's webpage**](https://aquelemiguel.github.io/artifact-beta-2.0-unofficial-api/) (you should see a .json file) and make a request to that URL. It's hardly an API, but calling it so sounds cooler than *formatted card list file*.  

### Attributes
Currently, all card info is automatically fetched by parsing files in the SteamDatabase [**GameTracking-Artifact-Beta repository**](https://github.com/SteamDatabase/GameTracking-Artifact-Beta).

| Implemented | Not found |
| ------------|-----------|
| card_id | stats (e.g. attack, health_points, mana_cost) |
| card_name | ingame_image |
| card_text | has_color booleans (e.g. has_blue) |
| card_type | |
| rarity | |
| references |  |
| card_lore | |

At this moment, I'd need **new data sources** to try to match the original API's size.

For instance, I'm yet to find any game files that store a card's mana, attack, armor and health values. If you find anything promising, let me know by [**emailing me**](mailto:miguelmanofernandes@gmail.com) or by [**submitting an issue**](https://github.com/aquelemiguel/artifact-beta-2.0-unofficial-api/issues)!
